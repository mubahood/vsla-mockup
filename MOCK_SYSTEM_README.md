- Medical terminology and structures
- Configurable data generators

#### 3. Mock Authentication (`src/services/AuthService.js`)
- Token-based mock authentication
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Password reset simulation

#### 4. Mock Storage System
- Uses browser localStorage
- Simulates database operations
- Persistent across browser sessions
- Prefix-based key management

### Mock System Settings
All configurable in `src/data/mockData.js`:

```javascript
// Adjust number of mock records
export const generateMockPatients = (count = 100)
export const generateMockStaff = (count = 25)

// Modify hospital information
export const MOCK_MANIFEST = {
  hospital_name: 'General Hospital',
  hospital_address: '123 Healthcare Street',
  // ... more settings
}
```

### Network Simulation
Adjust response delays in `src/services/api.js`:

```javascript
const simulateNetworkDelay = (min = 200, max = 800)
```

## 📊 Data Persistence

### Local Storage Structure
```
hospital_mock_users        # Staff/user data
hospital_mock_patients     # Patient records
foster_mock_training_sessions # Training session data
hospital_mock_departments  # Department info
hospital_mock_services     # Service definitions
DB_TOKEN                   # Authentication token
DB_LOGGED_IN_PROFILE      # Current user session
```

### Data Reset

```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.clear()
// Then refresh the page
```
