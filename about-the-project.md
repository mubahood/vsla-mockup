REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP)
CLOSING DATE: 17/09/2025 – 15:00HRS EAT
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (“FAO” or “Organization”) is an
intergovernmental organization with more than 194 member nations. Since its inception, FAO has
worked to alleviate poverty and hunger by promoting agricultural development, improved nutrition
and the pursuit of food security - defined as the access of all people at all times to the food they
need for an active and healthy life.
To achieve its goals, FAO cooperates with thousands of partners worldwide, from farmers’ groups
to traders, from non-governmental organizations to other UN agencies, from development banks
to agribusiness firms (further and more detailed information on FAO can be found on the internet
site: http://www.fao.org).
In preparing your offer, you should take into account the international status and activities of FAO
by submitting your best commercial terms. You should also be aware that FAO enjoys certain
privileges and immunities which include exemption from payment of Value Added Tax ("VAT"
or "IVA"), customs duties and importation restrictions.
FAO intends to award a Contract for the Development and Deployment of a Digital Management
Information System (MIS) for Farmer Field Schools (FFS) activities to promote agricultural
entrepreneurship and enterprise development under the Project ‘improving food security and
resilience of food production systems in Karamoja-FOSTER Project,
Purpose and Objectives
The main purpose of this assignment is to design, develop, and deploy a fully functional prototype
of the FFS Digital MIS that can be used to digitize the management of Agro-Pastoral Field Schools
(APFS) and their associated business initiatives using the Farmer Business Schools approach
including group savings and investment schemes. The system should be mobile-first, and offlinecapable, reflecting the digital realities of Karamoja. It is also expected to support real-time data
collection, provide localized advisory content, strengthen financial tracking, and enhance
monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) efforts.
More specifically, the assignment seeks to ensure that the MIS integrates core digital features such
as farmer group profiling, training logs, VSLA financial ledgers, E- Market place and interactive
e-learning modules. The service provider will also be responsible for building the digital capacity
of implementing partners, community-based facilitators, and extension workers through a Training
of Trainers (ToT) model. The MIS should be designed with a sustainability mindset, enabling local
institutions to eventually take full ownership of the system through structured capacity building
and technical documentation.
Scope of Work
The scope of the assignment covers the complete digital development cycle from system design
and development to user training and field deployment.
In the initial phase, the service provider is expected to hold consultations with FAO technical
teams, implementing partners, and local government officials to refine user requirements and align
functionalities with existing workflows. Based on these consultations, the provider will prepare a
brief that outlines a technical system specification, delivery schedule, and risk mitigation strategy.
The MIS development phase will involve building a modular platform consisting of distinct
but interconnected functionalities. These include:
a) A digital registry for FFS, FBS, and VSLA groups;
b) mobile-compatible tools for documenting Agro Ecosystem Analysis (AESA) and Good
Agronomic Practices (GAP) training sessions;
c) An e-advisory hub equipped with seasonal agricultural content and localized information; and
E- Market place to foster market linkages of agri-inputs, equipment service providers,
commodity markets etc
d) A digital VSLA ledger that records savings, loans, interest payments, and group-level financial
trends.
e) The system should also include a centralized M&E dashboard that allows real-time
visualization of project indicators, disaggregated by location, gender, value chain, and group
type.
The service provider will ensure the platform adheres to global best practices in cybersecurity,
digital inclusion, and ethical data governance. Special emphasis should be placed on enabling
offline-first functionality, and user-friendly interfaces that accommodate women, youth, and
persons with disabilities.

APPENDIX I
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Development and Deployment of a Digital Management Information System (MIS) for
Farmer Field Schools, Farmer Business Schools, and Village Savings and Loan Associations
under the FOSTER Project
Project Code UNJP/UGA/068/EC
Location Karamoja Subregion, Uganda
Duration 6 Months
Implementing Agency Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO), Uganda
General Description of Task(S) And Objectives to be achieved
Background and Justification
The Karamoja subregion, located in northeastern Uganda, continues to experience food insecurity,
environmental stress, and weak institutional systems, despite substantial investment in
development programming. Within this fragile yet dynamic context, the Farmer Field School
(FFS) methodology has proven to be a transformative approach for promoting participatory
agricultural learning, collective problem-solving, and climate-smart agricultural practices. Over
the years, the integration of Farmer Business Schools (FBS) and Village Savings and Loan
Associations (VSLA) has further enhanced the socio-economic impact of FFS by expanding access
to financial services and entrepreneurial opportunities, especially for youth and women.
Despite this success, the current implementation of the FFS-FBS-VSLA model has been
constrained by systemic challenges. These include fragmented data systems, reliance on paperbased documentation, limited access to timely advisory services, and weak mechanisms for
performance tracking and accountability. These issues have undermined the full potential of the
FFS platform as a mechanism for scalable and inclusive rural development. To address these
constraints, the FOSTER Project, implemented by FAO with support from the European Union,
aims to digitalize the FFS model by developing a robust, user-centered, and offline-capable
Management Information System (MIS). This system will enhance the delivery of agricultural
services, improve data-driven decision-making, and facilitate deeper financial inclusion and
community empowerment across all nine districts of Karamoja.
The MIS will serve as a core enabler of the broader digital ecosystem envisioned in the project
design, connecting farmers, facilitators, local government actors, and service providers through an
integrated platform that supports learning, monitoring, savings, and advisory content delivery. The
system will be designed in line with national policies including the Uganda Vision 2040, the
National Development Plan (NDP) III and IV, the Digital Uganda Vision, and FAO’s Strategic
Framework (2022–2031), while also complying with Uganda’s Data Protection and Privacy Act.
Purpose and Objectives
2
The main purpose of this assignment is to design, develop, and deploy a fully functional prototype
of the FFS Digital MIS that can be used to digitize the management of Farmer Field Schools and
their associated FBS and VSLA structures. The system should be mobile-first, and offline-capable,
reflecting the digital realities of Karamoja. It is also expected to support real-time data collection,
provide localized advisory content, strengthen financial tracking, and enhance monitoring,
evaluation, and learning (MEL) efforts.
More specifically, the assignment seeks to ensure that the MIS integrates core digital features such
as farmer group profiling, training logs, VSLA financial ledgers, and interactive e-learning
modules. The service provider will also be responsible for building the digital capacity of
implementing partners, community-based facilitators, and extension workers through a Training
of Trainers (ToT) model. The MIS should be designed with a sustainability mindset, enabling local
institutions to eventually take full ownership of the system through structured capacity building
and technical documentation.
Scope of Work
The scope of the assignment covers the complete digital development cycle from system design
and development to user training and field deployment.
In the initial phase, the service provider is expected to hold consultations with FAO technical
teams, implementing partners, and local government officials to refine user requirements and align
functionalities with existing workflows. Based on these consultations, the provider will prepare a
brief that outlines a technical system specification, delivery schedule, and risk mitigation strategy.
The development phase will involve building a modular platform consisting of distinct but
interconnected functionalities. These include:
a) A digital registry for FFS, FBS, and VSLA groups;
b) mobile-compatible tools for documenting agro-ecosystem analysis (AESA) and Good
Agronomic Pratices (GAP )training sessions;
c) An e-advisory hub equipped with seasonal agricultural content and localized information;
and E- Market place to foster market linkages of agri inputs , equipement service providers
etc
d) A digital VSLA ledger that records savings, loans, interest payments, and group-level
financial trends.
e) The system should also include a centralized M&E dashboard that allows real-time
visualization of project indicators, disaggregated by location, gender, value chain, and
group type.
The provider will ensure the platform adheres to global best practices in cybersecurity, digital
inclusion, and ethical data governance. Special emphasis should be placed on enabling offline-first
functionality, and user-friendly interfaces that accommodate women, youth, and persons with
disabilities.
The provider will also lead a comprehensive capacity development program based on a cascading
Training of Trainers model. This will target implementing partner staff, district production
officers, community facilitators, community health workers, and youth digital champions.
Training content must include system use, digital literacy, responsible data practices, and peer 
3
learning methodologies. Visual manuals, job aids, and interactive guides should be provided in
English and local languages.
The service provider will facilitate the physical deployment of the MIS in the field. This includes
the procurement and configuration of rugged Android tablets, their distribution to trained users.
The SP will track field adoption, provide remote troubleshooting, and document the onboarding
process through weekly progress reports and a final deployment summary.
The service provider shall ensure that the design and deployment of the MIS strictly adhere to data
privacy and security standards as set out in Uganda’s Data Protection and Privacy Act (2019) and
in accordance with FAO’s corporate data governance and digital ethics protocols. This includes
the implementation of role-based access control, secure user authentication, encrypted data
transmission and storage (both at rest and in transit), and anonymization or pseudonymization of
sensitive personal and financial data collected through the system. Informed consent procedures
must be integrated into the user registration process, with clear communication in local languages
regarding how data will be used, stored, and shared. The system should also include audit trails
and logging mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized access, and all digital devices used
for data capture must be password-protected and configured with remote wipe capabilities in case
of loss or theft. The SP will be expected to train relevant stakeholders ( 5 Implementin Partners in
Karamoja , Farmer Field School Facililators attached to these Implementing Partners plus
Community extension facilitators and Community Animal Workers centred at Village savings and
loans association level, are responsible data handling, digital safeguarding, and ethical use of
technology, and to document all security protocols within the system’s technical documentation
package.
